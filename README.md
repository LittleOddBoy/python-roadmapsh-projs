# Python projects, from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)!
If you are like me, trying new things usually and believe in learning by building sh*t, you would probably love [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)! Somewhere to not get overwhelmed with "tutorial-hell" and get the right thing done in the right way. This website has dedicated a *projects* section for most of the techs they have a roadmap for, where you can build things and learn new stuff. The Python version of it is where I am getting this project and can be found [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=python).

Here, is the link to the projects I made:
1. [Unit Converter](https://github.com/LittleOddBoy/unit-converter-py) ~ Convert a variety of units, right in your *localhost*!

feel free to contribute.
